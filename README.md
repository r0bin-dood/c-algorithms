# c-algorithms

Algorithms from "Introduction to Algorithms" 3rd Ed in C

The sole prupose of this project is to build a library of data structures and algrithms, and review core concepts. I aim to make the algorthims as "fast" as possible from a programmer's perspective with the intention to understand tricks and optimizations used by modern compilers today. Though mostly finished, I'll slowly push out changes and expect the project to be fully uploaded by the end of the month. On instructions on how to install and use the library, see below.
